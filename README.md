# Algorithms for fault detection of stochastic systems in multiple model framework
Variable Structure (VS) Interacting Multiple Model (IMM) state estimator implementation
An implementation of the VSIMM is based on series of papers by X. Rong Li. The main source is X. Rong Li (200) Chapter 10 EngineerÂ’s Guide to Variable-Structure Multiple-Model Estimation for Tracking.

The implementation of VS IMM state estimator is illustrated in two examples
example_maneuveringtarget.m - illustrates the use of the VS IMM for state estimation of a maneuvering target that undergoes different modes of motions (straight, turning with different turn rates). Details can be found in X. Rong Li (1999) Multiple-Model Estimation with Variable Structure Part iV - Design and Evaluation of Model-Group Switching Algorithm, IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, vol. 35, no. 1, pp. 242-254.
example_faultdetection.m - illustrates the use of the VS IMM for fault detection of additive faults described in multiple model framework. Details can be found in I. Puncochar and O. Straka (2022) Parity-Space and Multiple-Model based Approaches to Measurement Fault Estimation, In Proceeding of the 16th European Workshop on Advanced Control and Diagnosis, Nancy, France.

The main component of the VSIMM are implemented in following functions
vsimmkff.m - implements the filtering step of the VS IMM using the Kalman filter
vsimmkfp.m - implements the prediction step of the VS IMM using the Kalman filter
vsimmadatpre.m - implements the adaptation of set of active models (extension)
vsimmadaptpost.m - implements the adaptation of set of active models (discarding)
kfp.m - implements the predictive step of the Kalman filter
kff.m - implements the filtering step of the Kalman filter
normalizeweightexp.m - implements numerically robust normalization of weights to probabilities


There are also some auxiliary functions
gendrnd.m - implements the random number generator from discrete distribution with given probabilities
normrndm.m - implements the vectorized version of standard normrnd.m
isnotempty.m - implements the test for a nonempty array
tilefigure - implements the tiling figures
myprint - implements the printing figures into files
createmultiplemodels.m - implements creation of models for the second example
generateparametervariants.m - implements the construction of multiple model structure for given discrete set values of parameters of the model
mmmerge.m - implements merging of mean values, covariance matrices and probabilities for terminal subsequences of the multiple hypothesis tree
ps2pfs.m - implements merging of probabilities for terminal subsequences of the multiple hypothesis tree
smmkff - implements the filtering step of the Kalman filter for switch multiple model
